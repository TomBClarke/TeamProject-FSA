# Finite State Automata Generator

In the second semester of year 2 of University, myself and a team of five others under took the module 'Team Project'. Worth 20 credits, this was massively important to complete to a high standard.

The task was to 'create a visualisation of an algorithm'. Taking inspiration from the first few weeks of the same semester in models of computation, we created a program in Java that generates automata from regular expression, determinises it and also allows the user to test a string in it.

We used JavaFX for the GUI and visualisation, where me and another team member, Owen Pemberton, were the main programmers. The extensive project took 10 weeks, including creating a full set of documentation and tests for our program.

In the end, after a well recieved presentation of our project, we achieved an overall 73% for this module, which forms 20 credits of this 2nd year of study at University.

This repositorty is purely for preservation reasons and contains only the code. The software was originally version controlled with SVN which is why there is no commit history.

## Install and Run (requires Java 8 or newer)
* Run the compiled .jar file.

**OR**
* Open your IDE.
* Install the JavaFX required librarys (for Eclipse: [e(fx)clipse](https://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html)).
* Add the project.
* Go into build path settings, and add /res to the source folders.
* To remove all errors, add JUnit to the build path.
* Run the program from gui.main.MainWindow.

## Usage
* Run the program.
* From the menu bar at the top, view the help document.
